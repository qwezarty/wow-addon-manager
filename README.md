## Important

The purpose to build *wow-addon-manager* at the very beginning is to make an alternative **cli tool** to *Curse Client (integrate with Twich now, I don't like this)*.

This project is now in **early stage of development**. There's no stable release at all!

Now here is what you want if you're a *wower && developer*.

I'm enthusiastically hope you can join me and make any improvements or suggestions to it.

## Features will be supported

- source: curseforge(in process), wowinterface(planned)

- search/detail/install/remove addons(in process)

- check if there're addons outdated and update them(in process)

- local addons auto detected(planned)

- windows 10 will be full supported at release v1.0

## Setup notes

To clone and run the code, **Python 3 (with pip)** and **Git** should be installed.
